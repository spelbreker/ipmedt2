                    <p>
                        You are probably asking yourself: “what’s so special about the internet to make a website about
                        it?” – Well, as you probably know, the internet hasn’t been around for such a long time. Besides
                        that, people often think that the internet is just some miraculous ‘’thing’’ that just happens
                        to be there. Well it’s not! We’ve got a short, but fast paced video-clip for you that explains
                        where the internet comes from, and how it came to be!)
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        With the ARPA-network, internet became accessible to the greater public. By clicking on the
                        button below we will try to make a connection to the internet!

                    <h1>websites throughout the years</h1>

                    <p>(To the left/right, you can see an overview of the amount of websites that were online during the
                        last couple of years. Why are we showing you this? – Well, as of today, browsing is made so
                        easy, and the amount of information you can look up is tremendous, but it hasn’t always been
                        like that. </p>

                    <p>
                        There is a reason for the internet to become so popular. Between 1985 and 1995 the NSF (National
                        Science Foundation) had created an immense network, founded to promote the educational benefits
                        of the internet. During this period of time there emerged a couple of ISPs (Internet Service
                        Providers). Their goal was to make the internet accessible to the average civilian. After a
                        couple of years, 1991 to be exact, the NSF made an agreement with a couple of these ISPs,
                        stating they could use their network, providing they would pursue the following three
                        agreements:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>They would never diminish the accessibility of the NFS’s network;</li>
                        <li>The costs of the project should be evened out by their profits;</li>
                        <li>Any excess revenues should be used to enhance and extend the internet as it was knows at the
                            time.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        This is what caused the use of the WWW to start skyrocketing. The amount of websites that aired
                        started increasing every year, which you can see in the column chart to the left/right. You can
                        even hover over the chart to see the exact figures!

                    <p>
                        The upswing of the commercial internet also brought forth more and more interest in how to make
                        use of it. Therefore, a couple of developers started to recognize possibilities and made use of
                        them.
                        <br/>
                        Because of this, you see a great amount of popular and big websites arising around 1994. Most of
                        these websites are still used every day by people all around the world. But what are the stories
                        behind these websites? Who made them? What were the developer’s motives to realize these
                        websites?
                        <br/>

                    <h1> Wireless vs wired</h1>

                    <p>
                        Think to yourself: have you ever been in a situation like the man in the video just now? And did
                        you think to yourself how it’s possible to stay connected to the internet using your smartphone?
                        Again, many people don’t ask themselves these questions. But being able to use a smartphone is
                        all thanks to one of the most important developments concerning the internet: the foundation of
                        wireless networks, more often referred to as “Wi-Fi”.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The very first roots of these wireless network connections go back to the year 1971, but the
                        very first protocol for these connections didn’t exist until 1997. This protocol was called
                        802.11-1997 and could only have a link speed of 2 Mbit per second. This is equal to a download
                        speed of 250 kilobytes per second. Can you imagine? It hasn’t even been 20 years since we can
                        use wireless internet, and it used to be so slow!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Soon after the first release in 1997 there would be a new protocol, called
                        802.11b, which aired in 1999. This new protocol provided the user with way better link speeds
                        and better connectivity. Because of that, it resulted in the first real popularity regarding
                        Wi-Fi connections.
